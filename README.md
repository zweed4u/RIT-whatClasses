#RIT whatClasses
## UPDATED 29 August 2015

MyCourses now implements an external script to load classes, both past and present. This forced my hand to migrate to an actual webdriver as mechanize does not support this and I was not about to load a replicated script from source.  

**Enter selenium and phantomjs**  
What remains is a headless webdriver that supports javascript.  
This is the first of the RIT bundle I put together to be updated. I will slowly but surely working on correcting and ensuring functionality in the rest of the scripts.  

As always, contact me with any questions:
